# Web Scraping Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates web scraping using Python to extract and analyze data from websites. It utilizes libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` to fetch, parse, and process data into a structured format. The extracted data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features
- Sends HTTP requests to target websites.
- Parses HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
- Extracts specific data such as titles, links, and other elements.
- Processes and cleans the extracted data.
- Exports the data to a CSV file for further usage.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Libraries Used
- **requests**: For sending HTTP requests to websites.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and extracting data.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and exporting to CSV.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open the `Web_Scrapping.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to scrape the data.

Alternatively, you can execute the notebook from the command line:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute Web_Scrapping.ipynb
```

## Input and Output
- **Input**: A URL or list of URLs to scrape.
- **Output**: A CSV file containing the extracted and processed data.

## Key Components

1. **Setup**: Importing libraries and setting up the environment.
2. **HTTP Requests**: Sending requests to the target website(s).
3. **HTML Parsing**: Extracting required elements using `BeautifulSoup`.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Structuring and cleaning the scraped data.
5. **Data Export**: Saving the data into a CSV file using `pandas`.

## Example Use Case
If the project is scraping e-commerce websites, it may extract:
- Product titles
- Prices
- Ratings
- Links to product pages

## Customization
- Modify the `target_url` variable to specify the website(s) you want to scrape.
- Adjust the parsing logic in the `BeautifulSoup` section to match the structure of your target website.

## Notes
- Ensure you comply with the website's `robots.txt` and terms of service before scraping.
- Use proper headers and delays in requests to avoid overloading the server.
